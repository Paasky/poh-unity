        "description": "Snow is frozen precipitation that accumulates across temperate and polar regions, shaping seasonal economies, transport, and warfare. Indigenous Arctic peoples exploited snow\u2019s insulation in igloos and other winter shelters. Siberian reindeer herders tailored migration and fodder strategies to crusting and thaw cycles. In the Alps, reliable snow cover fostered modern ski resorts and tourism. Military campaigns have hinged on snowfall and cold, including urban fighting and supply failures during the Battle of Stalingrad. Spring melt drives water storage and irrigation downstream; the Colorado River headwaters depend on snowpack, linking mountain climates to agriculture and cities far away.",

Alaska\u2019s North Slope introduced a modern extractive phase, with Prudhoe Bay oil fields and pipeline infrastructure built on frozen ground. Conservation areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge protect migratory caribou and bird habitats.

North America\u2019s Great Plains shifted from bison ecology to wheat, corn, and cattle ranching under railroads and homesteading.

The Argentine Pampas evolved into a major grain and beef region integrated into world markets. Along the Nile, predictable floodplains underpinned ancient Egyptian agriculture and administration.

Lake Titicaca served Andean communities as a sacred landscape and a hub for canoe transport and interregional exchange.

In modern warfare, coasts become invasion fronts; the Normandy shoreline in 1944 enabled Allied amphibious landings.
