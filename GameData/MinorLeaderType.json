        "description": "Kaggen is the mantis trickster-deity of San oral tradition in southern Africa. Stories recorded among \u01c0Xam and other Khoisan groups present him as a shapeshifter who creates, disrupts, and instructs. Narratives describe his role in the origin of the eland, hunting customs, and social rules. He moves between animal and human form, testing boundaries and teaching through mischief and reversal. Nineteenth-century collections by Bleek and Lloyd preserved many variants, which continue to inform ethnographic understanding of San belief and ritual. Rock art sites in the Drakensberg and Cape region feature therianthropic figures and mantis motifs linked to trance experiences and healing dances. In initiation and healing contexts, Kaggen\u2019s stories frame endurance, cooperation, and respect for game. The figure remains central to discussions of cosmology, animal-human relations, and memory in Khoisan studies, tying myth to landscape, ritual performance, and subsistence practice."

Nujoma pursued national reconciliation, state-building, and the reintegration of Walvis Bay in 1994. His governments expanded education and health infrastructure and promoted land redistribution within a legal framework that later intensified. Namibia contributed troops to the SADC intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1998, reflecting his regional security outlook. A 1999 constitutional amendment enabled his third term. Nujoma stepped down in 2005 but remained an influential party elder. His tenure set the institutional foundations of the Namibian state and its foreign policy posture."

Early policies expanded education and health, while the Gukurahundi campaign in Matabeleland (1983\u20131987) left deep scars before the Unity Accord with ZAPU. Mugabe became executive president in 1987. Economic reforms in the 1990s gave way to fast-track land seizures after 2000, reshaping agrarian structures and triggering sanctions and economic collapse. Hyperinflation peaked in 2007\u20132008, followed by a power-sharing government. In November 2017 he resigned under military pressure.

Genealogies place her in foundational dynastic cycles that framed subsequent leadership claims. While documentary sources are scant, Portuguese accounts and Swahili chronicles from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries recorded fragments of these traditions. The figure marks a remembered transition from localized sacred rulership to broader maritime commercial orientation and, later, Islamization.

As imam and king, he maintained a conservative, isolationist regime, limiting foreign presence and negotiating from a position of tribal alliances. The 1934 Treaty of Taif settled a border conflict with Saudi Arabia and shaped regional relations. Administration relied on religious courts, tax levies, and negotiated autonomy for powerful clans. Efforts to modernize remained limited and selective. In February 1948 he was assassinated during a failed constitutionalist coup, after which his son Ahmad restored the dynasty.

His administrations expanded education and health services and promoted tourism and financial services. He maintained close ties with the Commonwealth and engaged the Non-Aligned Movement. In the 1980s he faced inquiries into drug trafficking and corruption, which he denied. Defeated in 1992, he retired from politics. He is central to Bahamian state formation and party politics."

Chroniclers connect him to the omen of an eagle on a cactus on a lake island. Under this leadership the migrants created a sacred precinct and waterways. The new settlement expanded through tribute, marriage alliances, and lake agriculture. Later lists include Tenoch among the first tlatoque, though his historicity remains debated. The city associated with him became the core of the Mexica Triple Alliance in the fifteenth century. Tenoch endures in foundation narratives that frame migration, sovereignty, and ritual space in the Basin of Mexico."

Katari coordinated with wider Andean revolt currents linked to T\u00fapac Amaru II while pursuing local demands for tribute relief and communal autonomy. Spanish counterattacks broke the encirclement, and he was captured near Pe\u00f1as. In November 1781 he was executed by quartering. The La Paz sieges exposed structural weaknesses in the colonial regime and forced reforms in defense and Indian policy. His name and deeds have been invoked by indigenous and nationalist movements in Bolivia since the twentieth century."

Inscriptions from Dvaravati (c. sixth to eleventh century) and Hariphunchai attest to rulers styled rajan who patronized Buddhist sanctuaries, issued donations, and managed regional networks. The term shows Indic political vocabulary adapted to local contexts. Mon courts linked temple foundations, rice hinterlands, and trade routes, often through vassal relations and ritual authority. The title persisted alongside Khmer and Tai titles as political centers shifted north and west. Epigraphic evidence and art history trace the office through dedicatory stones, Buddha images, and urban mounds across central and northern Thailand."

Porus fielded infantry, cavalry, chariots, and war elephants, forcing a difficult Macedonian crossing and inflicting heavy losses. Classical sources record his personal courage and command on the battlefield. Defeated but not destroyed, Porus negotiated with Alexander, who restored him to his throne and enlarged his domain as a loyal ally. This arrangement stabilized Macedonian control east of the Indus and provided a buffer against other Indian states. Porus continued to rule after the Macedonian withdrawal, maintaining the political structure of the Paurava realm.

The narrative appears in the thirteenth-century Samguk Yusa and later texts. Over centuries, dynasties and local communities conducted Dangun rites and commemorations. The story informed territorial origin claims and ritual calendars, including observances akin to modern Gaecheonjeol. Scholars treat the account as mytho-historical, yet its themes shaped early Korean identity and statecraft narratives.

Rhee insisted on a hard line against the North and prioritized security alliances, notably with the United States. Domestic politics under his rule became increasingly authoritarian, with restrictions on opposition parties and the press. Economic recovery proceeded unevenly amid war damage and limited resources. Disputed elections in March 1960 triggered mass protests known as the April Revolution. The uprising forced Rhee\u2019s resignation and exile. He died in Hawaii in 1965.

It appears in personal names of Gallic elites recorded by Caesar and in inscriptions, such as Vercingetorix of the Arverni, Ambiorix of the Eburones, and Dumnorix of the Aedui. The term derives from the Indo-European root for rulership, related to Latin rex and Sanskrit r\u0101ja. Usage indicates hereditary or elective leadership within tribal confederations, often alongside councils and druidic influence. The suffix marks both status and lineage claims in late Iron Age Gaul and persists in modern place and family names derived from those leaders."

As queen of England and duchess in her own right, she managed estates, promoted commerce, and fostered troubadour culture. In 1173\u20131174 she supported the revolt of her sons against Henry II and was imprisoned until his death in 1189. Eleanor then acted as regent for Richard I, organized his ransom, and administered Aquitaine. In John\u2019s reign she continued to broker alliances in France. She retired to Fontevraud Abbey, where she died and was buried. Her career shaped the Plantagenet empire and the politics of medieval France and England."

He lured the Roman legates Sabinus and Cotta into a fatal retreat and destroyed their column near Atuatuca. He then besieged Roman positions and waged mobile warfare that exploited winter dispersal of the legions. Caesar responded in 53 BC with punitive operations intended to annihilate the Eburones. He invited neighboring tribes to plunder their lands, devastated settlements, and broke the tribe\u2019s cohesion. Ambiorix evaded capture, reportedly crossing the Rhine. His final fate is unknown. The revolt forced Caesar to concentrate forces and adjust supply lines, and it encouraged wider resistance among Belgic communities. Ambiorix\u2019s campaign remains a noted example of asymmetric warfare against Roman occupation and winter garrisons."

She endorsed steps toward a redefined relationship with Indonesia, foreshadowing the postwar decolonization process later completed under Queen Juliana. Citing health, Wilhelmina abdicated in 1948.

He built the Arab Legion with British officers and consolidated authority over tribal and urban elites. The Treaty of London in 1946 recognized the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan with Abdullah as king. During the 1948 war he deployed the Arab Legion in Jerusalem and the West Bank, then annexed the territory in 1950. His rule mixed cautious diplomacy with reliance on British subsidies. Abdullah pursued quiet contacts with Israel that angered Arab rivals and Palestinian opponents. He was assassinated at the al-Aqsa Mosque in 1951. His reign laid the foundations of Jordanian state institutions and monarchy."

He is known from the Amarna letters, where he corresponded with the Egyptian court amid rivalry between Mitanni and the rising Hittite Empire. The letters show a besieged city\u2011state seeking protection, reporting enemy movements, and requesting troops and gifts. Akizzi navigated alliances with neighboring polities while acknowledging Egyptian suzerainty. His dispatches illuminate the weakening of Mitanni authority and the fragmentation of Syrian power networks. Archaeology at Tell Mishrifeh (ancient Qatna) confirms a rich urban center with palatial architecture, though earlier prosperity had already waned. Akizzi\u2019s dossier offers a close view of Late Bronze Age diplomacy, courier systems, and the language of loyalty that structured relations between great kings and vassals."

Ethnographers in the late 19th century described Altjira in relation to the Dreaming, the sacred time of creation and law. Narratives attribute the formation of landforms, beings, and social patterns to this ancestral power. After shaping the world, Altjira is said to have withdrawn, leaving behind sites, tracks, and ritual obligations. The name intersects with terms for Dreaming itself, and its interpretation varies across sources. Ritual knowledge and songlines preserve these associations within specific kin and totemic ties. Later scholarship debates the extent to which earlier accounts merged local concepts, yet Altjira remains a reference point for Arrernte cosmology."

It appears in early steppe confederations and gains prominence under the Mongol Empire, where Chinggis Khan and his heirs established dynastic khanates. The title spread through Kipchak, Cuman, and Oghuz polities and persisted in Kazan, Astrakhan, and the Crimean Khanate under Ottoman suzerainty. In Central Asia it marked rulers of Uzbek and Kazakh hordes and later became an honorific in Persianate courts. Administrative records, coinage, and treaty formulas attest to its wide usage. Examples include Golden Horde khans and leadership among the Kipchak confederations."

The Kyrgyz maintained ties with the Tang while navigating the resurgence of the Second Turkic Khaganate under Qapaghan Qaghan. In 711, a Turkic campaign led by Tonyukuk, with princes Bilge and K\u00fcl Tegin, struck the Kyrgyz. Bars Bek was killed in the fighting, and the Kyrgyz leadership was disrupted. Despite this setback, the polity endured on the Sayan\u2013Altai frontier and later re-emerged as a major steppe force in the ninth century when it toppled the Uyghur Khaganate. Bars Bek stands at the start of this trajectory as the first named Kyrgyz sovereign."

His regime curtailed parties and the press while promoting Lithuanian language, education, and state institutions. Diplomacy managed strained relations with Poland after the loss of Vilnius, and sought security through neutrality and cautious Western contacts. In June 1940 the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum; Smetona departed into exile as occupation began. He died in the United States in 1944.
