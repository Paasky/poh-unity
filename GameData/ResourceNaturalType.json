Farmers selected larger cobs and soft kernels, enabling diverse cookery and storage. Nixtamalization with alkali improved nutrition and dough quality. The crop anchored milpa systems with beans and squash, fixing nitrogen and stabilizing yields. Maya and Aztec polities relied on maize tribute and labor rations. Tortillas, tamales, and atole structured daily meals and festivals. Granaries and field rotation sustained high population densities. After 1492, maize spread to Europe, Africa, and Asia through imperial and merchant networks. It supported peasant subsistence in the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and southern China. Hybridization and altitude-tolerant landraces allowed cultivation from lowland tropics to Andean highlands, making maize a global staple.",

Husks contain saponins that deter pests; washing prepared the grain for porridge, stews, and flatbreads. Cultivation integrated with camelid herding and frost-avoidance planting calendars. Spanish colonial rule reduced its prestige in some regions, but it persisted in indigenous agriculture. Modern research resumed in the twentieth century, expanding acreage in Bolivia, Peru, and beyond.

Farmers valued the plant for seed protein and for nitrogen fixation in rotations with millet, wheat, and rice. Han and later dynasties documented tofu, soy milk, and fermented pastes. Techniques diverged regionally into Chinese jiang, Japanese miso and shoyu, and Korean doenjang and ganjang. By the seventeenth century the crop spread to Japan and Korea at scale. Western awareness grew after eighteenth-century botanic exchanges. Industrial crushing in the twentieth century made soybean oil and meal central to global food and feed. The crop moved into Brazil and the United States Midwest through breeding for temperate day lengths. Soya remains a cornerstone of East Asian cuisines and world protein supply.",

Neolithic sites such as Ganj Dareh and \u00c7ay\u00f6n\u00fc show managed herds supplying meat, milk, hides, and bone. Their browsing ability suited arid hills and scrub, enabling pastoral expansion into marginal lands. In the Levant and Mediterranean, goats contributed milk for fresh cheeses and played roles in sacrificial rites. Transhumant and nomadic systems moved flocks between seasonal pastures, integrating with cereal agriculture and trade. Fibers from specialized breeds, including cashmere and mohair, entered textile markets. Colonial and early modern reports note both utility and landscape impacts from overgrazing. Across West Asia, North Africa, and southern Europe, goats provided dependable household subsistence and exchange value from prehistory through the modern era.",

The biology of fig\u2013wasp pollination shaped regional cultivation, while caprification practices were recorded by classical agronomists. Dried figs moved along Roman and later medieval trade routes as durable provisions. Monasteries and Islamic estates maintained fig cultivation, integrating it into irrigation systems. Early modern expansion carried figs to Iberian colonies and the Americas. The fruit persisted as a staple of Mediterranean diets and a notable commodity in dried form.",

England shifted from unhopped ale to hopped beer in the 15th\u201316th centuries, spurring cultivation in Kent. Major hop-growing regions emerged in Hallertau (Bavaria), Bohemia, and later the Pacific Northwest. Hopping stabilized beer for transport, enabling larger-scale commercial brewing and export. By the 19th century, specialized varieties and kilning techniques supported industrial breweries in Germany, Britain, and the United States, influencing global beer styles from Pilsner to India Pale Ale.",

Indigenous communities in the Andean region and the North Pacific used them for food, clothing, and tools. European explorers and sealers took sea lions opportunistically in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

By the twentieth century, national protections and marine mammal laws in the United States, New Zealand, and South America restricted hunting.

        "description": "Turquoise is a blue to green copper-aluminum phosphate valued for its opaque color and fine polish. Ancient Egyptian mines in Sinai and Persian deposits near Nishapur supplied early jewels and inlays. The material circulated through Anatolian and Mediterranean trade into medieval Europe, giving the stone its French name. In Iran and Central Asia, craftsmen set turquoise in weapon hilts, mosque fittings, and court jewelry. Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica produced mosaics and ceremonial objects for Aztec and Mixtec elites. In the American Southwest, Puebloan, Navajo, and Zuni artisans integrated turquoise with silverwork and ceremonial regalia. Qing workshops combined turquoise with jade and gold for court ornaments. Stabilization and reconstitution techniques expanded modern use as high-grade sources declined.",

        "description": "Jade encompasses two tough ornamental stones, nephrite and jadeite. Neolithic cultures in China shaped nephrite into polished axes, bi discs, and cong tubes used in ritual settings. The material acquired enduring prestige in Chinese court culture, culminating in Qing virtuoso carvings. In Mesoamerica, jadeite from Guatemala\u2019s Motagua Valley furnished Olmec and Maya figurines, earspools, and regalia linked to royal display. Polynesian and M\u0101ori artisans fashioned nephrite, known as pounamu, into adzes and heirloom ornaments. European Neolithic societies distributed alpine nephrite axes over long distances. The nineteenth century brought significant jadeite trade from Burma to China. Modern markets distinguish sources and treatments, with imperial green jadeite commanding the highest prices.",

        "description": "Quartz is a common silicate mineral occurring in many varieties, including colorless rock crystal and colored chalcedonies. Prehistoric communities flaked and ground quartz for tools and projectile points. Rock crystal vessels and amulets appear in Greco-Roman and medieval contexts. High-purity silica sand became a key input for glassmaking in Roman, Venetian, and Bohemian industries. Carvers shaped crystal reliquaries and lens-like ornaments for churches and courts. Scientific study identified piezoelectric properties in the late nineteenth century, enabling resonators and precision timing in the twentieth century. Quartz sands support foundry molds and ceramics. Gem varieties such as amethyst and carnelian served jewelry markets across Asia and Europe, with extensive workshops in India and the Islamic world.",
