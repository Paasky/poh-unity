        "description": "Pine forests are coniferous woodlands spread across boreal and montane zones. They supplied straight timbers for building and ship masts, and resin, tar, and pitch for sealing and waterproofing. Norse and Viking communities felled pine for longships, halls, and farmsteads. Siberian peoples harvested resin and relied on pine for shelter and fuel. Early modern navies drew naval stores from Baltic and North American pines. Industrial logging fostered rail-linked sawmills and tar distilleries. Reforestation and plantation forestry reshaped landscapes in Sweden, Scotland, and Japan during the 19th and 20th centuries. Fire, pests, and climate variability drove new silviculture practices. Today pine forests are managed for timber, pulp, carbon storage, and watershed protection while sustaining local crafts and subsistence.",

This enabled Iberian exploration and empire and supported transatlantic merchant traffic and the triangular trade.
