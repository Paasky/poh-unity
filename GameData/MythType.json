Coronations held before her shrines conveyed lawful rule and continuity. Urban surveyors offered libations at key points to bind streets and walls to sacred order. Comparable cults appear with Ninhursag in Mesopotamia, Cybele in Anatolia, and Isis in Hellenistic states, where state festivals tied political power to maternal divinity. In many calendars her feast opened civic years, and guilds of midwives, magistrates, and builders kept altars in administrative quarters."

Elite companies traced mythical descent to it and used totems in oath rites. Seasonal royal hunts of lions or bulls doubled as training and public theater, as in Neo-Assyrian campaigns. Greek narratives of Heracles and the Nemean lion furnished a heroic template. Chinese and steppe banners carried beast emblems to rally formations. Feasts followed successful hunts, linking martial prowess to civic protection and the provisioning of troops."

Roman suovetaurilia purified fields and affirmed plenty through the sacrifice of pig, sheep, and bull. In the Andes, state-managed llama and alpaca herds supported storehouses and redistribution. Granaries, markets, and weights often bore animal emblems to mark lawful measures and reliable supplies."
