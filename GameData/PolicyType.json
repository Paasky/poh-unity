Authority is divided between central and regional governments, often protected by judicial review. The United States defined this model in 1789, balancing national powers with state sovereignty and testing the settlement in the Civil War. Switzerland consolidated its cantons under a federal constitution in 1848 and refined it by referendum and consensus practice. The Federal Republic of Germany rebuilt federalism after 1949 through the Basic Law and cooperative institutions. India formed a union of states after 1947, reorganizing linguistic boundaries and developing strong emergency provisions to manage diversity and crisis.",

Wahhabi movements in the Arabian Peninsula sought to purify worship and reorganize tribal politics under strict monotheism. After 1979, Iran institutionalized clerical oversight, Islamic courts, and religious vetting of officials. Taliban administrations enforced conservative dress codes, gender segregation, and religious schooling. Supporters frame the order as faithful restoration. Critics record curtailed civil liberties and suppression of minority sects. Outcomes depend on local institutions, clerical authority, and external pressure.",

Stalinist purges fused ideology with security services, producing show trials, expulsions, and forced conformity in science and culture. Authoritarian religious councils have issued binding interpretations and sanctioned rivals. Dogmatism narrows debate, reduces experimental policy, and entrenches patronage networks. Stability can increase in the short term. Long-term effects often include intellectual stagnation, underground opposition, and brittle legitimacy when crises expose contradictions.",

The state funds clergy, regulates doctrine, and often links officeholding to religious conformity. In Britain, the monarch is Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and ecclesiastical appointments historically intersected with politics. Lutheran state churches in Scandinavia shaped schooling, parish records, and welfare provision. The Ottoman Empire structured administration through Islamic law and a millet system for recognized minorities. Modern constitutions may retain establishment while expanding civil rights. Reforms commonly separate fiscal support from doctrine and remove legal disabilities for dissenters, yet ceremonial roles and concordats can persist.",

Early precedents include the Edict of Nantes, which granted restricted toleration to French Protestants, and the pluralist Dutch Republic after the Reformation. The U.S. First Amendment created a durable model combining nonestablishment with free exercise. Contemporary secular constitutions protect minority communities and enable voluntary institutions. Implementation varies. Some states retain blasphemy laws or registration regimes that burden small groups. Durable pluralism tends to correlate with commercial openness, urbanization, and independent courts that enforce neutral rules.",
